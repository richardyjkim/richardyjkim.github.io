# 01 Challenge Horiseon


## Description 

Introducing new seach engine optimizer: Project Horiseon, is here to increase your web accessbility

To take a first step to become a junior Developer, I think it would be a great chance for me to Refactor what is already been wonderfully made. The website itself is already systemetically made however I can little help to make this optimizer to increase accessbility just little more

As I am refactoring I saw some of the Links and Attributes are not properly linked and selector and properies are not consolidated, yet some of them are easily recognizable. Doing all these works surely made me to chooes proper tags and selector and how they functions correctly. most importantly, how it is important to consolidated and refactoring.
